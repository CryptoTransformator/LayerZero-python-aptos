# LayerZero-python-aptos

The idea behind this repo is to replicate some core bridging functionality
to make someting like LayerZero-aptos-sdk but for Python.

`js` folder contains some code to make experiments with official SDK easier.
`src` is our python implementation which tries to mimic JS as close as possile.
